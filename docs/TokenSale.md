# TokenSale Smart Contract Documentation

## Introduction

The TokenSale contract is a comprehensive solution for conducting token pre-sales and public sales. It caters to projects seeking to launch new tokens or distribute existing ones, providing a structured and secure environment for token transactions.

## Design Choices

Sale Stages: Implemented a state machine pattern to define distinct stages (PreSale, PublicSale, PostSale), offering clear transitions between different phases of the token sale.
Contribution Limits: Set minimum and maximum contribution limits to ensure fair participation and prevent abuse.
Caps Management: Integrated mechanisms
Caps Management: Integrated mechanisms for setting pre-sale and public sale caps to manage token distribution effectively.
Token Rate Management: Facilitates easy setup and adjustment of the token exchange rate against ETH, essential for dynamic pricing strategies.
Refund Functionality: Included a refund mechanism for specific scenarios, enhancing trust and flexibility for participants.
Token Distribution Control: Empowers the contract owner with token distribution capabilities, ensuring controlled and deliberate allocation of tokens.
Security Measures: Applied best practices like check-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate risks such as reentrancy attacks.

### Key functionalities include:

Token Purchase: Participants can buy tokens by sending ETH, adhering to the defined contribution limits and current sale
Token Purchase: Participants can buy tokens by sending ETH, adhering to the defined contribution limits and current sale state.
Update Caps and Contribution Limits: Allows the contract owner to modify pre-sale and public sale caps and set minimum and maximum contribution amounts.
Token Distribution: The contract owner can distribute tokens directly to addresses, providing flexibility in managing token allocations.
Claim Refund: Under specific conditions, contributors can claim refunds, adding a layer of trust and security for participants.
Sale State Management: The contract owner can transition the sale state, ensuring a structured and timely progression of the token sale.

## Security Considerations

Reentrancy Guard: The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard, offering protection against reentrancy attacks.
Access Control: Functions critical to the operation and integrity of the token sale are guarded with onlyOwner modifiers, ensuring that only the authorized owner can execute them.
Input Validation: The contract rigorously checks for valid inputs and states, preventing unauthorized or erroneous actions.
