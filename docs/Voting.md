# Voting Smart Contract Documentation

## Introduction

The Decentralized Voting smart contract offers a transparent and secure platform for conducting elections or polls within a decentralized environment, like DAOs or other community-driven entities. It empowers participants to vote on candidates or proposals in a tamper-proof manner, ensuring the integrity of each vote.

## Design Choices

Error Handling: Custom error messages for various fail conditions, enhancing clarity and reducing gas costs compared to traditional revert strings.
Immutable Owner: The contract owner is immutable, ensuring a consistent point of authority.
Voting Mechanism: Implements a straightforward voting mechanism, where registered voters cast votes for candidate IDs.
Security Focus: Inclusion of checks for valid voting periods, voter registration, and duplicate voting, to ensure the legitimacy of each vote.
Efficient Data Management: Uses mappings for storing voter and candidate information, optimizing for gas efficiency and data retrieval.

## Usage Guide

Deployment: Set the voting duration at deployment.
Voter Registration: Users call registerVoter to become eligible to vote.
Candidate Registration: The owner registers candidates with registerCandidate.
Casting Votes: Voters call vote with the candidate ID.
Winner Announcement: After the voting period, the owner calls declareWinner to announce the result.

### Key functionalities include:

Voter Registration: Functionality for voters to register, ensuring that only authorized individuals can vote.
Candidate Registration: Only the contract owner can register candidates, maintaining control over the election setup.
Voting Process: Registered voters can vote for candidates within the voting period, with checks to prevent double voting or voting after the period ends.
Winner Declaration: The contract owner can declare the winner after the voting period, based on the highest votes received.

## Security Considerations

Reentrancy Protection: Guards against reentrancy in critical functions.
Restricted Access: Functions like registering candidates and declaring winners are restricted to the owner.
Time-Based Logic: The contract relies on block timestamps, which should be considered in terms of potential miner manipulation.
