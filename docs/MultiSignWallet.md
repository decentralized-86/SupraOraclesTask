# MultiSigWallet Smart Contract Documentation

## Introduction

The MultiSigWallet contract is a robust solution for managing collective funds, requiring multiple verified parties to authorize transactions. This ensures a high level of security and shared control, ideal for decentralized organizations and collaborative projects.

## Design Choices

Pattern Adoption: The contract employs a widely-used multisignature pattern to enforce collective agreement on transactions.
Ownership Tracking: Utilizes mappings to track the approval status of each owner.
Approval Mechanism: A minimum number of approvals (required) is necessary for transaction execution, balancing security with operational efficiency.
Modifiers: Custom modifiers ensure checks for transaction existence, approval status, and execution, enhancing code readability and security.

## Usage Guide

### Key functionalities include:

submit: Initiate a transaction, restricted to wallet owners.
approve: Sign off on a transaction, limited to one approval per owner.
execute: If the transaction meets the required number of approvals, it can be executed.
revoke: Owners have the option to withdraw their approval.
Upon deployment, the contract must be initialized with a list of owner addresses and the minimum required approvals.

## Security Considerations

Checks-Effects-Interactions: This pattern is crucial for preventing reentrancy attacks. In MultiSigWallet, it ensures that state changes (effects) occur before external calls (interactions), minimizing risks.
Unique Owners: The contract validates the uniqueness of each owner to prevent duplications, enhancing the integrity of the ownership structure.
Modifiers for Access Control: Key functions are safeguarded by 'onlyOwner' modifiers, ensuring that only designated owners can execute certain actions, thus maintaining strict control over wallet operations.
