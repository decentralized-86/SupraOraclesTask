# Solidity Programming Interview 1

Welcome to the repository for the Solidity Programming Interview 1. This repository showcases a series of Solidity smart contracts designed for various decentralized applications as part of a coding interview process.

## Directory Structure

- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contract source files.
- `test/`: Test scripts for smart contracts to ensure correct behavior.
- `docs/`: Documentation detailing design choices, contract usage, and examples.
- `scripts/`: Deployment and interaction scripts for the contracts.

## Getting Started

To get started with these contracts, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/decentralized-86/SupraOraclesTask]
cd [SupraOraclesTask]


# Documentation
For a deep dive into the contracts, refer to the docs/ directory. The documentation covers the rationale behind design decisions and provides context for the smart contract capabilities.
